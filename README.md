# TFSLOT01

Our [TFSLOT](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TFSLOT01) sensor is an airspeed sensor designed to use on UAVs. Due to 3D printed case it is possible to optimize the characteristics according to the location of sensor on UAV and specific application. First use of this sensor is on our autogyro [TF-G2](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TF-G2/).


# Advantages to pitot-static tube

In cotrast to classical [Pitot tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitot_tube), the TFSLOT design is perfect choice for low airspeed measurement (generally bellow 20 m/s).
The design has following advantages compared to Pitot_tube

  * Better resolution on low airspeed
  * Less tendency to clogging
  * Direct differential pressure sensor integration without any additional tubing.
